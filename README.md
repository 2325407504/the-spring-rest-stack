The Spring REST Stack
=====================

This is the accompanying code to my talk, "Building REST APIs with Spring." I *strongly* encourage you to check out the webinar replay
on [the SpringSource Developer Channel](http://youtube.com/SpringSourceDev) and to take a look at [the slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/rest-apis-with-spring) in order to get everything possible from this webinar.

If you have questions on this, I of course [can be reached on Twitter (@starbuxman)](http://twitter.com/starbuxman).
